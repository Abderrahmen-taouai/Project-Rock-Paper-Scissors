In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt. 
All style was done with Javascript.

I was able to manipulate DOM.
Use Events.
Re-arange a code and clean it.
I did all the Styling this time only with Javascript with differents methodes call in a single file.
I gues it took me like 12 hours, specaily the styling it's all by script at least it took 4/5 hours.
